- We need to decided weather we want to use a grid view, like in the lights out program
- or a list view
- and how we will store the list
	- like in an array
	- or some other structure
- I think a grid view is better because we can have lots of rows and only 1 column but idk if a grid view scrolls
- whatever you guys think is best
- I made this at API level 15 bc its what it defaulted to. idk how impactful that will be in the future
