### Things to do

- We need to decided weather we want to use a grid view, like in the lights out program
- or a list view
	- I believe that a list view will have the ability to scroll so I think a list view may be easier but not sure. someone should research that
- and how we will store the list
	- like in an array
	- or some other structure
	- again need to think about what the best way of storing abunch of strings are, also other settings like date and priority
	- maybe a tuple? if that exists in java.
	- something like ["this is a reminder","high","10/19/20"]
	- probably could use int values for priority: 1 = low, 2 = med, 3 = high
	- ["this is a reminder v2", 1, dateobject?]
- Also need to think about how the three seperate pages will work. The daily, weekly, and monthly
	- Do we just grab reminders by their date?
	- If date = today -> display in daily activity
	- If date is in this upcoming week -> display in weekly activity
	- If data is in this month -> display in monthly activity
- Then after figuring all of that out:
	- How will we grab the priority and display it differently? how to do that java wise
- Need to dissect chiccas code to see how creating notes works, but cant get it to run on my computer, if one of you guys could figure it out would help a ton
- Also final thing, I made this at API level 15 bc its what it defaulted to. idk how impactful that will be in the future
